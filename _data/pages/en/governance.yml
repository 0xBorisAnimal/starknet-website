    title: Starknet Governance
    description: Read all about the first phase of Starknet overnance.
  - type: markdown
    body: >-
      The first phase of Starknet Governance has been launched (more
      details [here](https://www.starknet.io/en/posts/governance/starknets-governance-first-phase)).
      From now on, community members can participate in shaping Starknet through
      a further channel, namely voting on protocol changes.


      In its first phase, Starknet governance will focus on Starknet protocol upgrades. Every Starknet version upgrade will be deployed on Goerli Testnet; voters will then have a 6-day period to examine and test the upgraded version as it runs on Goerli. During this time, a Snapshot proposal will be opened, and the community can vote on whether to approve or reject the upgraded version for Mainnet deployment.


      If the proposal gains a majority of ‘YES’ votes during the six-day voting period, the proposal passes and Starknet mainnet will be upgraded accordingly. We expect the vote on [Starknet Alpha v0.11.0](https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/starknet_versions/upcoming_versions/#what_to_expect) to be open soon.


      We encourage you to read all the details in the following posts and engage with the discussions in the [Starknet community forum](https://community.starknet.io/).
