      # Starknet Governance: First phase


      The first phase of Starknet Governance has been launched (more details here). From now on, community members can participate in shaping Starknet through a further channel, namely voting on protocol changes.


      In its first phase, Starknet Governance will focus on Starknet protocol upgrades. Every Starknet version upgrade will be deployed on Goerli Testnet; voters will then have a 6-day period to examine and test the upgraded version as it runs on Goerli. During this time, a [Snapshot proposal ](https://snapshot.org/#/starknet.eth)will be opened, and the community can vote on whether to approve or reject the upgraded version for Mainnet deployment.


      If the proposal gains a majority of ‘YES’ votes during the six-day voting period, the proposal passes and Starknet mainnet will be upgraded accordingly. We expect the vote on [Starknet Alpha v0.11.0 ](https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/starknet_versions/upcoming_versions/#what_to_expect)to be open soon.


      We encourage you to read all the details in the following posts and engage with the discussions in the [Starknet Community Forum](https://community.starknet.io/).
