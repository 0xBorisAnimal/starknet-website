      The goal of this
      article(and [repository](https://github.com/starknet-edu/starknet-stack))
      is to use a layered tech stack to create a conceptual model for StarkNet.
      To better understand our StarkNet stack we will also operate the protocols
      locally.


      StarkNet is a Layer 2 Validity Rollup which operates “***on top***” of Ethereum Layer 1. At a conceptual level we can think of this as a stack of protocols that separates concerns in the various layers. A simple analog is the model used to represent your internet connection the OSI Model:

      ### StarkNet Stack


      These models can be split in various ways for instance OSI vs TCP/IP as you can see above. The *correct* modelis the model that works best for your understanding. Guilty Gyoza separates the verifiable computing stack stack as [follows](https://www.guiltygyoza.xyz/2022/05/verifiable-computing-stack):

      A simplified model for the modular blockchain stack may look something like this:

      ### Setup


      There are various hardware [specs](https://github.com/rocket-pool/docs.rocketpool.net/blob/main/src/guides/node/local/hardware.md) including packaged options that will enable you to run an Ethereum node from home. Our goal is to build the cheapest StarkNet stack possible:
